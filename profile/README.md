# Malware Hunter Project

## üîç Problem
It is a fact that Android has become the most used operating system on mobile devices, especially smartphones. Among the reasons for this dominance, the study points out the cost (price) of smartphones and the variety of applications (apps) available. According to data from Google Play, users have access to more than three million applications for Android devices from developers around the world. This massification makes Android the most exploited operating system in terms of security, primarily through malicious applications (malware).

## üéØ Goals

The Malware Hunter project aims to develop new techniques for automatically detecting Android malware by identifying features associated with malicious behavior, improving the security and robustness of embedded software (applications) on Smartphones. The project's scope consists of implementing two solutions: one based on association rules, where pre-specified statistical thresholds are used, and (2) one based on supervised machine learning techniques.
